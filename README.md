## About

It is tool for protecting the integrity of an ELF binary. It extracts the `.text` section of an ELF, and sign it with **RSA** private key. Finally, append the signature as another section.

For a [Linux kernel with signature verification function](https://github.com/mrdrivingduck/kernel-with-elf-signature-verification), during the process of `execve()` system call, it will extract the signed section and the signature section, and verify the integrity of the ELF binary. If it cannot pass the verification, the ELF will not be executed. The certificate for verification should be compiled with Linux kernel together.

## Sign an ELF Binary

Firstly, install the dependencies:

```bash
$ sudo apt install libssl-dev libelf-dev binutils openssl
```

Then, build the tool by `make` command:

```bash
$ make
cc -o elf-sign elf_sign.c -lcrypto -lelf
cc -o sign-target sign_target.c
./elf-sign.signed elf-sign sha256 certs/kernel_key.pem certs/kernel_key.pem
--- [elf-sign]: 64-bit ELF object
--- 29 sections detected.
--- Section 0014 [.text] detected
--- Length of section [.text]: 5394
--- Section [.text] Buffer size: 5394
--- Signature size of [.text]: 465
--- Writing signature to file: .text_sig
--- Injecting signature section: [.text_sig]
--- Removing temp signature file: .text_sig
```

The `elf-sign.signed` ELF binary has already been signed by the private key in `certs/kernel_key.pem`, so that it can pass OS's verification to sign the newly built `elf-sign`. Then, with a signed `elf-sign`, you can sign other ELF binary on our system.

```bash
$ ./elf-sign sign-target sha256 certs/kernel_key.pem certs/kernel_key.pem
--- [sign-target]: 64-bit ELF object
--- 29 sections detected.
--- Section 0014 [.text] detected
--- Length of section [.text]: 418
--- Section [.text] Buffer size: 418
--- Signature size of [.text]: 465
--- Writing signature to file: .text_sig
--- Injecting signature section: [.text_sig]
--- Removing temp signature file: .text_sig
```

The program will back up the `sign-target` to `sign-target.old`, and generate a new signed `sign-target`. To check the result, use `readelf` or `objdump`:

```bash
$ readelf -a sign-target

It means that the tool works fine.

## Generate Private Key

Firstly, configure some basic information of the key in `certs/x509.genkey`:

```
[ req ]
default_bits = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
prompt = no
string_mask = utf8only
x509_extensions = myexts

[ req_distinguished_name ]
O = WatchDog
CN = ELF verification
emailAddress = mrdrivingduck@gmail.com

[ myexts ]
basicConstraints=critical,CA:FALSE
keyUsage=digitalSignature
subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid
```

Then, generate the key through `openssl` command:

```bash
$ cd certs
$ openssl req -new -nodes -utf8 -sha256 -days 36500 -batch -x509 \
    -config x509.genkey -outform PEM
    -out kernel_key.pem -keyout kernel_key.pem
Generating a RSA private key

........................................+++++
writing new private key to 'kernel_key.pem'
-----
$ cd ..
```

This is the file for signing a signature. Also, the file should be compiled with kernel to become a built-in key for signature verification.
